Vertical Scroll Bar Management

This hack works around the mystery behind wxWidgets wxScrolledWindow and wxVScrolledWindow

1. Implement virtual wxCoord OnGetRowHeight(size_t) const and return a constant, 8 sounds good to me
2. Create one child, wxPanel, put everything in it with a sizer
3. Create a wxBoxSizer and add the wxPanel, align top, align left, no border
4. Create EVT_SIZE handler, EVT_SIZE(ClassName::OnSize)
   In the size handler, get the panel size, virtual size, client size
   Set the panel width to the client width
   Set the virtual size to have the client width
   Set the row count to the max(panel height, client height) / row height
   See CPanelLabLocusThresholds for an example.
     Create a general purpose function with the following args to be called from OnSize()
       (wxWindow *pScrolledWin, wxWindow *pPanel, wxCoord nRowHeight);
       
When the window is created, the scrollbar is not shown, whether or not it is needed.  
The window must be resized smaller to show it.
