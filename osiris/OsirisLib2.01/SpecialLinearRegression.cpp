//
//  class SpecialLinearRegression performs linear regression on a predetermined number of points but returns only the linear term, and the
//  data average, but not the constant term.  This will be useful in dealing with STR raw data from .fsa files.  This class uses the 
//  formulas in "Numerical Recipes" by Press, Flannery, Teukolsky, and Vetterling, p. 505.  The class assumes that the "x" values are:
//  1, 2, 3,...., N, where N is the numberOfPoints set on construction.  Regression can occur forward or backward from the indicated array
//  pointer that is input to the regression calculation.
//
