To change the version of Osiris, the following needs to be done:

1. Edit the image, OsirisAnalysis/Osiris*.png with the correct version.  
This is done by typing the version into wordart.doc, 
doing a print screen and paste into a blank graphic using MS-Paint
then copy/paste the version number into the osiris image.

2. Run f2d.pl in the OsirisAnalysis directory using the image file
name as the command line argument.  This will generate osiris_png.h
which is used for the splash screen.

3. In the setup project, in Setup1 directory, set the name of the
output .msi file to reflect the new version.

4. Edit Version/OsirisVersion.h to update the version.

   Rebuild ALL!

   On a UNIX machine, do a fresh git checkout of
   internal/osiris in a new directory.
   In the osiris directory run

5. When distributing to the public or releasing a beta,
   update the web site in
   /net/mwebtest2/export/home/web/public/htdocs/projects/SNP/osiris
   make sure TMP_DEBUG is not defined in osiris.m4 

  Update the version info in version.cgi

6. For a non-public release, go to 
   /net/mwebtest2/export/home/web/public/htdocs/projects/SNP
   and run the following on the command line:

   ls -1 osiris/version.cgi >> .sink_thesefiles


7.  For a public distribution look at README.md
    https://bitbucket.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/OS/repos/osirisweb/browse
